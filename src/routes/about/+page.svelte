	<p class="my-3">
		This is a web app that allows you to check unit growths in Fire Emblem Engage. I was inspired to
		develop this app upon seeing that other resources like Serenes Forest kept growth data between
		classes and units separate, meaning it was inconvenient to have to switch between the different
		pages just to find the overall growth rate for one specific unit-class pair.
